        <div title="Thursday, November 04, 2010" class="two-margin journal-text">
        
          <p>So, I'm pregnant. Pregnancy alone is exhausting, but keeping up with 3 year old (almost 4) twins while pregnant is practically debilitating. The kids are normally so well behaved, so when I just couldn't keep my eyes open any longer, I told them to behave and I was going to lie down a little bit. I told them to come get me if they needed anything! They were coloring and being so good, so I felt comfortable doing it. Boy, was I wrong!!
</p>
<p>I hadn't been lying down for long when Antonio came in the room and said, "Mommy, you have too much hair." I looked at him and noticed he had a pair of scissors in his hand. I replied, "No I don't." His response..."Sissy did."
</p>
<p>I flew out of the bed! I rushed into the next room and she had mutilated her hair! And apparently, Antonio helped! I immediately started crying and yelling, asking her why she would cut her beautiful hair. I just kept asking her why over and over.
</p>
<p>I truly couldn't believe the mess she had made with her hair. I called Holly, crying and asked if she could try to fix it. (I'm not sure what I was thinking, exactly. It isn't like she put the hair back on her head!) She said she would squeeze us in and we could go down in an hour or so.
</p>
<p>I took a few quick pictures of her haircut to document the mess she made. When I went to take a picture of her, she started smiling. Mean, upset Mom that I am, I told her "Don't smile! You are in trouble!"
</p>

</p>
<p>We headed to Holly's and she attempted to clean up the choppy mess she had made in the back. Unfortunately, there wasn't really anything she could do with the front. While she was cutting it, Analise fell asleep in the chair. I had to stand next to her and hold her head up while Holly finished. Thankfully, at this point, I was slightly less hysterical.
</p>

</p>
<p>After the "fix" I went and bought a bunch of thick headbands to help cover the mess. Thankfully, it works. Well, to a degree.

          <p>Always an adventure. They did pretty good today though. No complaints. And free hotdogs. The best part though, we got some nice new furniture.
</p>
<p>When we got home Isaiah said, "Where is it?" I guess he thought the new furniture would beat us home and be set up by the time we got here. That would have been nice.

          <p>I have a special, different relationship with each of my kids. I love each one of them as much as the other, but the relationship I have with each is different. </p><p>Antonio is special. He is my first son. He is so smart and funny and determined and competitive! He has so many traits that I just love. Every day he makes me proud, even the days he makes me crazy. </p><p>His 3rd grade teacher at Floyd Elementary, Ms. Sprague uses Class Dojo (an app) that monitors her students progress throughout the day. They get positive points for a variety of things they do well and negative points when there are issues. So far this year, (we're a month in) he hasn't gotten any negative points. I'm not surprised by this at all as he prides himself on succeeding, especially in school. But I just love checking the app throughout the day and seeing the positive points he earns. It brings a huge smile to my face and pride to my heart to know others recognize how awesome he is. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/3223/2017/06/21/amy2_edited2_6c97dd7e-7979-40cc-9e5a-53e1f4421151.png" /><p></p>

          <p>Isaiah's first game was tonight. It was kind of a rough start, as he had fallen asleep on the way home from Grandpa's house about an hour before the game. Dressing him was interesting, as I had to do it while he was still sleeping. He just didn't want to wake up! When we got there, he didn't want to play or even be there. Thankfully, he was able to get himself awake enough to play, after much prodding and promising of fun after, and when the game time actually started he was ready to go. And he did a great job! </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2015/09/14/Isaiah_before_soccer_a6f96075-70c1-454f-b56f-751a42d54006.jpeg" /><p> Before the game</p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2015/09/14/Isaiah_before_soccer2_12426c3c-74f5-406f-8d6f-9f010d4dc6d9.jpeg" /><p> </p><p>During the game: </p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2015/09/14/Isaiah_soccer_during_5dd78f58-f85e-4794-a851-e95900677eb3.jpeg" /><p> </p><p>After the game: </p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2015/09/14/Isaiah_soccer_df0d83da-73b1-4c7a-ad61-85bd72cca35f.jpeg" /><p> </p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2015/09/14/Isaiah_soccer2_1662c2ef-1ad5-480e-b1bf-93b743deb37a.jpeg" /><p> </p>

        <div title="Saturday, September 12, 2015" class="two-margin journal-text">
        
          <p>Antonio had his first football game this morning. We arrived on time and everything!! This is no small feat, considering we had to be at the field by 7:45 a.m. and I was flying solo. Ben was in Cedar City running a half marathon so unfortunately he had to miss the game. But the kids and I managed to get up and out on time, even eating breakfast first!
</p>
<p>The game was almost unbearably hot! With the morning sun right in our faces, and the reflection off the aluminum bleachers, I was drenched in sweat before the game even began. At some point during the second quarter, friends (okay, sort of friends...I know them but don't really hang out with them) invited me down to share their shade. I was immensely grateful!
</p>
<p>The boys did a great job during the game. I can't really say, personally, if Antonio did a good job as I had an extremely difficult time spotting him the entire time. The team's jerseys didn't arrive in time for the game so they were all out there in their white practice jerseys. They all looked the same. I could tell if it wasn't him if the boy had on a bright undershirt or bright cleats, but otherwise, I was lost.
</p>
<p>He told me he thought he did a good job, and that speaks volumes as he is usually pretty hard on himself. So we will take it as a very successful first game. The Pahrump Valley Mighty Mite Trojans won the game 20-0!

          <p>Tonight, at Isaiah's soccer game he was completely cracking me up. Considering he is so shy in so many social settings, he totally shocks me on the soccer field! He is funny, loud, talkative, aggressive-ish...anything but shy! Tonight, he was all of those things. Yelling "NO!" if the other team scored. Yelling "YEAH!!!" and fist pumping the air if his team scored. He would run and then roll on the ground before hopping back up and continuing on. I couldn't stop laughing at how silly he was being.
</p>
<p>Near the very end of the game, I believe it was the last play, the ball was kicked off by the other team, he stole it, it got kicked away from him but he managed to stop it, turn it around and went in for the score! He scored his first goal!! He did a fist pump and turned and looked at me with his arms raised. Of course, I was yelling what a great job he did. The game was ending so he ran to me for a big hug. It was the best thing ever! He was so excited. I just love that little guy and watching him play soccer is some of the best entertainment ever.

          <p>If it could go wrong, this morning it did. Okay, it wasn't really that bad, but it definitely wasn't great!
</p>
<p>I got up about 10-15 minutes earlier than normal. Not that that was exceedingly early, but it was earlier, so that meant I should have been ready to go earlier, right? Wrong!!
</p>
<p>I'm honestly not even sure what happened to the time this morning. Before I knew it, we were running late. But before we could get everyone in the car and on the road, Antonio couldn't find his hat for his reward day. That caused tears and me to run back inside to see if I could help him find it. No luck.
</p>
<p>While we were inside doing that, Analise accidentally knocked over the cup of cereal Antonio had in the car. Yes, spilled cheerios in the car! :(
</p>
<p>After another quick breakfast grab we made it out of the house. We were running late enough that I had to take Analise and Antonio to school before taking Isaiah to the babysitter. While Isaiah was glad to get to wave bye to the kids at school, he was then very sad to find out that he had to go to the babysitter.
</p>
<p>We are having a rough time this year with the babysitter and he was not excited to go. So I had to leave my crying baby at the sitters. It hurts my heart so much to have to leave him, especially when I know he isn't happy. I know he is in good hands, but I hate knowing how much he doesn't like it. I only hope he loves school next year. Otherwise we could be in for some rough mornings. :(
</p>
<p>I think I need a do-over. So far, this Monday sucks!<span></span><br>

We went to visit Grandma Mary and Grandma Opal first, as always. Then we went to Nick and Charese Moore's house. Isaiah was terrified of all their spooky decorations!</p><p>Next we went to the Wombaker's house (a new one for us). Then we headed to Aunt Becki and Uncle Ben's house. We visited there for a while and Aunt Becki told us that Uncle Ben is having some issues with his heart. He is having multiple tests done, but he doesn't have enough blood pumping. Scary!! Analise got in a bit of trouble with Aunt Becki for not listening and had to sit by her on the couch. She did a good job of holding in her emotions for most of the time, but then she cried on me for a little bit.</p><p>After Ben and Becki's we stopped by Bob and Joan Hammond's house and then by the Lindberg's house. After that we headed to Janelle and Sergio's house. They were nice enough to feed us dinner. It was delicious!</p><p>All in all, it was a successful evening of trick or treating. The kids have more candy than they could possibly eat and we all got to bed at a decent time. Add to that, we got to fall back!! Woohoo for an extra hour of sleep!</p>

          <p>I hate when my kids are sick. :( Isaiah was sick last night. I'm relatively certain his issue stemmed from too much drainage and a runny nose, but nevertheless he was throwing up at 1:30 a.m. Ben had consoled him initially when he was getting sick in his bathroom and then brought him to bed with us.</p><p>I couldn't fall back asleep right away as he was making noises showing his discomfort and I was rubbing his back trying to soothe him. It wasn't very long after he laid down in our bed that he was making noises like he was going to be sick again. Ben rushed him to the bathroom (he is closer) and he was getting sick again. Knowing I had to be up around 5 a.m., I tried to stay in bed and fall back asleep but he was crying for me.</p><p>When I went into the bathroom to see if he was okay, he was crying and he said to me, &quot;Mooooom. I just like you.&quot; It made me giggle a little and I told him I liked him too. Then he was telling me that it was the worst day ever and he didn't want to be sick. I finally convinced him to get in the shower with Ben and that it would make him feel a little better. After much debate, he conceded and I was able to head back to bed.</p><p>I was up by 5:25 and was getting ready as quick as my exhausted body would allow me to, so I could be out the door by around 5:50 a.m. I succeeded. I'm not sure how, but I made it.</p><p>Thankfully, Isaiah woke up feeling better (at 9:30 a.m.).</p>

          <p>As is our nightly routine, Isaiah was watching Daniel Tiger before bed. He was in our bed watching it and Ben was flossing and brushing his teeth. </p><p>I had just come out of the bathroom from brushing my own teeth and climbed into bed. <br /> </p><p>Moments later, Daniel Tiger said, &quot;corn. That's right. Do you see the corn?&quot; To which Isaiah responded, &quot;It's right there in front of your face.&quot; I'm not sure he meant it as snarky as it came out, but it sure was funny!!<br /> </p>

          <p>Antonio is such a tough kid. And also extremely dedicated to school. His tooth is really bothering him, on the bottom left side of his mouth. It is loose, but the teeth next to it keep him from being able to wiggle it backward, only forward. </p><p>This morning, his jaw was a little swollen and his tooth was really bothering him. He took some medicine and was determined to tough it out. I, on the other hand, am very nervous about it. I'm afraid of infection. I tried to see if I could get him into the dentist. He could get in today at 2:15, but that would make him be absent from school (leaving before 1:45 makes you absent for the day). </p><p>I called to check on him, and was able to talk to him. He said it doesn't hurt as bad and he doesn't want to leave school to go to the dentist. So, we are going to let him tough it out and just hope no infection is involved. Fingers crossed. </p><p>I just love that kid and his determination not to miss school. <br /> </p>

          <p>We ended up taking Antonio to the dentist on Friday morning (well, Ben took him). I knew there was a reason why his jaw was swollen beyond a loose tooth. And I was right.</p><p>He had an infection in his jaw and it was so swollen, the dentist couldn't pull his tooth yet. So she made an appointment for this coming Friday, letting him be on the antibiotics for a week to get the infection under control. </p><p>We also found out she is going to pull both of his incisors, even though only one is loose and causing issues. It is so they will grow back in evenly. </p><p>The appointment is at 7:30 a.m. and we are hopeful he will be finished in time for us to rush back to school so he isn't considered absent. </p>

          <p>When we arrived in California for the Knotts competition, we arrived on Saturday afternoon. Analise had traveled down on Friday with a cheer friend to spend the day riding rides with her family. We waited until Antonio's baseball game ended on Saturday to head down. We arrived around 4 p.m., picked Analise up from the park, got checked in and then headed to the beach. I love the beach. I would love to live closer to the beach so I could hear the ocean, and spend my evenings taking walks along the shore. </p><p>Anyways, we were going to pick up Subway on the way to the beach and have a picnic, but every Subway we passed (7 of them!) were on the other side of the street with no easy way to get to and get back on our way. So, we decided to have a little snack and then grab dinner when we were finished playing at the beach. We headed toward Huntington Beach, found a spot to park and headed to the water to play. </p><p>The kids loved it! They played in the water, despite the fact that it was much cooler than I would prefer (I was in pants, a sweatshirt and cuddled under a blanket!) and windy! But that didn't deter them. They had a great time in the water and building sand castles. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_7874_1d0ee56f-706b-41d1-9268-838c1d8ae188.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6587_6175740f-b511-4a49-9be4-8b667f7b0401.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6604_261ce75e-36f4-4e84-9df7-dde29d757c59.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6607_403dfd99-302c-4877-b45a-64353978522d.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6612_af074bfc-9530-4ee6-acc6-f48b5a4962dc.JPG" /><p> </p><p><br /> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6634_849c5005-f687-4afd-ba77-78804064f2ad.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6656_4688b0ae-f7ba-40d2-a009-9472e40c45e0.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6659_8fda48d9-6956-4d11-8bf0-36c9eb154316.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6666_b48d683a-9eaa-42b7-974d-ceae386452a8.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6669_8652117a-6435-45ea-a99f-05edbf615bed.JPG" /><p> </p><p><br /> </p><p>Once the kids were sufficiently soaked and frozen, we headed for dinner.

The twins went on a few kiddie rides with Isaiah too, making him happy. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6674_fb75be3f-01bf-4f2c-a55d-f3d8f6d32382.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6671_7f5b640f-b0fc-441f-bdca-aa9aee7dce1d.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6676_ba4c2053-27ea-4f13-86bb-fcf26695eac1.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_7952_ceae33f4-1ba2-40d8-9e75-70af32e2a507.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_7959_bc9c49fa-5e25-4c90-92d0-cc07dff53d0f.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_7958_2e7dc88e-6fea-49a4-87a5-9d2e1be516e1.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_6678_71eebdcf-d94c-4d4d-bca6-9efc212c0260.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_7961_50468321-2c8f-4d3a-b608-53e613a7b799.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/06/01/IMG_7963_98afadb7-cb9e-44ea-a5f5-f9746c8dd450.JPG" /><p> </p><p>My favorite part had to be that Isaiah was finally willing to hug the characters and take a picture with them.

          <p>Isaiah and Olivia celebrated their 5th birthday at Pump It Up with a fun, little party. I had planned Isaiah's party and was trying to work around multiple schedules including cheerleading and baseball and the schedules of friends and family so those we wanted at the party could attend. Desiree, who has been busy herself with kids' sports and school schedules, work and building a home and preparing to move, asked if she could just piggy-back on Isaiah's party for Olivia. That was fine with me because they were going to attend anyway, and having someone else cover a little of the costs was helpful. </p><p><br /> </p><p>Attending the party were my three kids; Analise, Antonio and Isaiah, as well as Desiree's three kids;  Alina, Aydon and Olivia. Also in attendance were friends Jaycee Hayes (who rode in with Armando and Desiree), Kamden Moore (Isaiah's best friend who rode in with us, thrilling Isaiah beyond belief), Blake and Dax Jones, as well as Hudson and Easton Jones. It wasn't an overly large party, but all involved had a nice time.<br /> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/05/20/IMG_6847_b02130b1-e184-46c6-8ba0-8f43937d8c19.JPG" /><p>(Dax isn't pictured) </p><p>Isaiah had a white cake with white whipped frosting. On the cake was Spiderman and a picture of Isaiah. He was very excited that his picture was on the cake too. And my boy sure loves him some cake! I think he gets that from his Momma. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/05/20/IMG_6841_700a5097-1ede-4b62-8db9-51b0d60427e2.JPG" /><p> </p><p>The party was a huge success. Now I just need to get used to the fact that my baby is 5! </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2016/05/20/IMG_6881_d7e6ec03-2144-4453-9166-5590851b568b.JPG" /><p> </p>

          <p>Analise had been dying to have her hair cut! She wanted it cut for several months, but I told her she had to wait until cheer was over, so I wouldn't struggle to get it up in a high pony tail for competitions. The season ended and 4 days later, she got it chopped! Went from long with no bangs, to short with bangs. And my oh my, she is such a gorgeous girl!

          <p>We went to Katie's house last night for a Memorial Day cookout. Katie fed us delicious burgers, corn on the cob, baked beans (I didn't have any of those...yuck!), chips and dip, watermelon and ice cream for dessert. Katie and her boys were there, as were Aunt Lois and &quot;Mom&quot;. Her nephew Will stopped by for a little while too. The food was yummy and the company was even better.</p><p>It is always great spending time with Katie and her family. She is such a good hostess and an even better friend. The kids played very well together, playing on the slip and slide, having a water balloon fight and riding on the zipline. As they were playing, and I watched Isaiah on the zipline, I couldn't help but ask myself, when the heck did he get so big? He was riding it by himself, with no support. He did great, even if I held my breath the entire time he rode it. I just can't believe he is 5 and on his way to Kindergarten. Seriously kid, slow down!!</p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2281394/2016/05/31/bc44053f22b21d721693fa8c35fc6631_4ba74e70-90c1-4253-a91e-3409636a53dc.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2281394/2016/05/31/b542536632b7d023f54ced5c3d0fa3e7_bd278f4d-cb47-4963-9204-e560c4260ed7.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2281394/2016/05/31/ad064d9ed7debc1410e892382bb5b691_2e9a381d-62ee-44b4-9339-1cd2fdae025e.jpeg" /><p></p>

        <div title="Monday, July 04, 2016" class="two-margin journal-text">
        
          <p>Tonight we watched the fireworks show that the Nugget put on from Preferred RV's pool. When we originally got to the pool, it was completely crowded. Lots of people, and they were being rather loud. I wasn't excited about trying to get in the pool. We decided to go eat the pizza we brought for dinner at a picnic table on the grassy area and decided we could just watch the fireworks from there.
</p>
<p>However, at about 8:40ish, everyone seemed to clear out of the pool. So we decided to go ahead and get in the pool. We got in and were just in time to head out to the deep end and enjoy the show. We floated on noodles and relaxed in the pool to watch the show. It definitely wasn't the best show we've ever seen, but it definitely scored bonus points because of where we got to watch them from. Then, after the fireworks show, we played a little pool volleyball and Isaiah practiced swimming without his vest with Analise's help and then mine.
</p>
<p>He did amazing! He swam almost the entire length of the pool without his vest. I'm so proud of his determination to learn how to swim without it. And he was very proud of himself as well! He just keeps getting bigger on me! I'm not sure how this is happening so incredibly fast.
</p>

</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dominique did a little shout out to each of the kids who went to camp. Here is what she had to say about my amazing kiddos.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO Veloz- You have been bringing focus thats outta this wrld dude!! Way to step up today and wrk/o with the heavy weights!

          <p>Analise and Isaiah both had their first games at 9 am. I watched Analise first, then headed to Isaiah's game. I watched him score a goal and then at his halftime headed back to watch the rest of Analise's game. She did awesome as a defender! <br />
</p>
<p>Then we all headed to Vegas for Antonio's game. He didn't get to play much but they won 27-0! We hope next week he'll get to play more!

          <p>Pumpkin carving!! Time snuck up on us this year so we were limited to one pumpkin the night before Halloween. <br>We had a little trouble deciding on how to carve it. Antonio drew the mouth he wanted on a piece of paper. Isaiah was 10% certain he wanted a triangle nose. Analise had a little trouble articulating how she wanted the eyes. While they didn't end up exactly how she wanted I think she was okay with the Gina product. <br>The funniest part to me was Isaiah's refusal to use his hands to clean out the pumpkin. We finally got him to stick a hand in to push out the nose. <br>The kids are too funny sometimes!</p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28572" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image00_135e4e27-0f87-4eb8-a8b6-9c9d58e3263b.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28573" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image01_1b941a9f-0f8b-4412-8ede-5d052b6421ba.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28574" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image02_42f279e9-6287-4d19-8f65-d2855d17faca.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28575" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image03_76e35b9d-7b2b-43c9-9b0d-489bf016b82d.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28576" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image04_f9eee7ca-2ceb-47b6-8ebd-773b2e3c9c87.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28577" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image05_a9b1453e-bef1-4da7-851e-9b18c5bdbf69.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28578" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image06_41d99e50-fb04-4568-8fa2-854b7c620ab0.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28579" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image07_ebe4b107-e44c-434a-b86c-b7d65d6c7d0b.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28580" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image08_467988bb-88da-458f-9d86-e94fe7a8cbd4.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28581" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image09_f40c8dc1-8e55-4f8a-a7a9-9fa05058827a.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28582" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image10_d9d58545-65ea-400b-9d04-62234a916b9a.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28583" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image11_b0163f09-e5dd-4951-bdf1-a95c783a817c.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28584" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image12_7bfeb68f-b3b4-4d7b-a5a1-3dcbc6c6d063.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2380309_entry_image_28585" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2380309/2016/11/02/image13_a7ba710f-d483-4783-b857-4c9a73d711ec.jpg"></p>

          <p>Saturday I was solo with my kiddos. We had a full day!! <br>It started with Isaiah's soccer game at 9, where I played coach. </p><p>At 11, Analise had her game. It was a little rough since they had also had a game Friday night so they were all dragging a little. </p><p>Right after soccer we headed to Vegas for Antonio's game. They lost in a game that is being disputed because of players on the other team being overweight. </p><p>After the game we headed to watch Trolls! I think I was more excited than the kids. It was fantastic! We all loved it!! And of course, we all had to take pictures as Trolls after. </p><p>Then it was haircuts for the boys and dinner with Ben, Armando and Zo.

The kids had a fun time playing. Analise hauled Hudson around like he was a little monkey attached to her most of the day. Antonio played a lot with Easton and some with Dax and Isaiah mostly did his own thing, although he played with Blake more than usual, and there was even a hand-holding moment that I may or may not have encouraged. They were super cute!</p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/01/16/IMG_9658_968c0756-72a4-455a-b7a3-9d8f12205ddf.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/01/16/IMG_9662_dc1e0593-5c1a-46e6-9532-cf772609ecd8.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/01/16/IMG_9677_ad04b928-6c8f-48c7-ad0d-8ea949c05a33.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/01/16/IMG_9672_31c51a6b-beab-4c52-aa7e-8ab86ef040b2.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/01/16/IMG_9683_95e56866-3334-42c3-a388-167b5b1c56f2.JPG" /><p></p>

        <div title="Monday, January 16, 2017" class="two-margin journal-text">
        
          <p>Isaiah is such a funny boy! We were at the movies yesterday and he was being a bit of a cranky monster. Earlier in the day we had gone to Hudson Jones' 3rd birthday party (The party was held a little late. His actual birthday is Dec. 24) and after, we surprised the kids with a trip to the movies. For whatever reason, Isaiah did not want to go. We didn't give him a choice and so he went with us. I took the kids to see Monster Trucks while Ben went to watch Why Him? (a more grownup movie). <br /><br />Anyway, we were about half-way through the movie and had finished eating our popcorn, when I decided I needed something sweet. I pulled a candy bar from my purse that I had bought on Saturday as a fundraiser. I was eating the first little square of chocolate, when Isaiah whispers to me, &quot;What do I smell?&quot; I replied, &quot;I don't know, what does it smell like?&quot; He took a big sniff and said, &quot;It smells like chocolate.&quot; I giggled and asked him if he wanted a piece. He said, &quot;A piece of what?&quot; I said, &quot;Of my chocolate.&quot; He gave me a big grin and a head nod. <br /><br />All I could do was shake my head and giggle at him. Such a funny boy.<br /><br />The movie was good. At least, I liked it. Antonio thought it was great and Analise thought it was okay. I got a fair-weathered response from Isaiah, but I'm sure it was more because he was still being cranky. He kept his eyes on the movie the entire time, other than when he was stealing my chocolate, so he couldn't have hated the movie! The cranky remained the rest of the day until bed time.<br /><br />I only saw him for a few moments this morning and he seemed to be in better spirits. I hope he's in a better mood tonight than he was last night.</p>

          <p>You know, it's the little things that will sometime completely make your day.</p><p>   Isaiah is an incredibly picky child.</p><p>   Almost every night the answer to asking if he wants dinner is &quot;that's disgusting!&quot; Even if he has never ever tried it. </p><p>  Tonight, I made a recipe I saw on FB (slow cooker Mongolian beef) and thought it looked good. I was making some stuff for lunches this week at the same time so I had white rice and brown rice going. </p><p>  As I was dishing up dinner Isaiah asked what it was. I told him it was Meat with rice (making it simple). He asked, &quot;is it white rice cause I hate white rice.&quot; I told him I made him brown rice. His response was &quot;good.&quot;</p><p>   As we were eating dinner he asked if he could have more meat because he loved it. </p><p>  I about choked and almost made Ben choke when I grabbed his arm and asked him if he heard him. </p><p>  He ate seconds (3x as much as I originally gave him). He asked if there were leftovers if he could have them for dinner tomorrow if he didn't like dinner.</p><p>   I can't even begin to say how excited this made me. Isaiah told me I did a good job with the challenge. When I asked if the challenge was to fix something he actually liked, his response was &quot;Yep!&quot; </p><p>   He's so funny. And I'm glad I finally found something he truly liked! Definitely made my day.</p>

          <p>Spent some one on one time with this cutie tonight while the other two were at basketball practice. He is so funny and smart! I love taking to him and listening to him tell me stories.

          <p>Antonio competed in the grade-level spelling bee today. I'm so proud of him. He got runner-up this year, which was disappointing for him. </p><p>But,&nbsp;he lost well. He told Lilly she did a good job and there were no tears. I'm very proud of him. He got out on insulin. It was a seventh grade word, and we stopped studying after sixth grade. Now its time to study the seventh and eight grade words to get ready for the district bee next week. </p><p><img id="entry_2464024_entry_image_48931" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2464024/2017/01/31/image00_844a91e3-db99-481b-9378-d6bb6819e256.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2464024_entry_image_48932" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2464024/2017/01/31/image01_ea937ddd-a266-4503-90c2-568ca8294db0.jpg"></p><p><img id="entry_2464024_entry_image_48933" src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2464024/2017/01/31/image02_a8caba16-92c7-4e4d-a468-e0dcd9f2a0f9.jpg"></p><p>I waited until tonight to tell him I won't be able to be at the district spelling bee.

They have been so very excited about it, talking for weeks about how much fun it is going to be.<br /><br />Last night, I helped them get ready for it.

          <p>Last night was the first night of the weekend birthday party. Both kids had basketball games. From there, Antonio, Analise, Isaiah, Carter Nygaard, Serenity (Tink) Lewis, Jackson and Travis Floyd, and Kamden Moore along with Katie and I all headed to the pool. </p><p>We made a quick stop at Little Caesars for some pizza, breadsticks and soda and then we headed to Preferred RV. </p><p>We ate dinner in the dining room area there and then headed out for the kids to swim. Katie and I opted out and instead sat and visited while the kids swam. They all had a great time and everyone got along beautifully! </p><p>After swimming we headed back to our house for homemade ice cream cake. It was my first time making it and I was afraid it wouldn't turn out but it was great! </p><p>Once cake and presents from Jackson and Travis were opened, Jackson, Travis, Carter and Antonio headed to Katie's house for a sleepover. Kamden and Tink stayed here for a sleepover. Everyone played for a little bit until just before 11 and then went to bed. </p><p>Kamden and Isaiah woke up at 6, ready to play Minecraft again. They didn't want to be up alone so I joined them in the game room. I cuddled under a blanket on the couch while they played. I have to say it was a successful start to our party weekend. On to round two!</p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8466_1df31068-0288-49c8-9d4c-ba63b219a975.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8468_2a0060d2-102c-408f-81b9-e35a3f9d4dad.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8471_d6d37bca-16b1-4f85-95ae-b97c5be13b16.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8473_42e66f30-4afc-4b37-b518-46f46f04e803.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8476_14b97888-3611-4287-a479-b80134cf2f8c.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8477_36b4fe3a-4ad9-4051-a6b6-62bdc563833f.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8478_efe1b513-00e7-42c4-94e7-d12d484d5ccb.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8479_50c73dc2-cc7e-4543-b6bd-9bdb481f9fa9.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8480_addbb7e1-8657-4e9b-a956-30fde9afd3b9.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8486_bc2ff407-211a-4608-9f6f-faf62bb4b26a.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8489_ecab5b6b-a5d5-46e7-b6d5-a132e663dfc1.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8490_61631e02-8657-4fe7-be2e-8d04354aba8d.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8491_efcb8ea5-164a-4c46-a43d-86efa8e97b01.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8493_ecb90a35-8097-4160-a055-dda3966fdbf0.JPG" /><p> </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8494_d1bbbfc4-d98b-4cc9-8ba6-f310fbd38d2b.JPG" /><p> </p>

          <p>Man, it was rough getting up this morning! Isaiah and Kamden were up at 6 a.m. After staying up until 11! I drug myself up with them and hung out on the couch in the game room while they played Minecraft. Ben and the girls were up by 7, and Ben was nice enough to make me a cup of coffee. <br /><br />When I finally felt alive, it was time to get moving. From about 8 a.m. until 2 p.m., I spent my time preparing dinner for the party, cleaning up the house, fixing lunch and decorating the cake. <br /><br />About the cake…have you ever had a moment where you feel completely inadequate? As I was decorating the cake, I was feeling like it wasn’t good enough. It wasn’t as pretty or fancy as a big store bought cake, the bottom layer broke in half when I was getting it out the pan and I was frustrated and wanted to cry.<br /><br />But I was able to pull through. I salvaged the bottom layer and was able to push it together and glue it with the frosting. The decorations on it weren’t what you’d see from a fancy cake place, but all the kids loved it. They each, separately told me how great it looked. That made me feel so much better! I don't know if they knew I was feeling insecure about the cake, but they made my day telling me how much they loved it.<br /><br />We went to the bowling alley a little before 4 p.m. We got all of the setup done and were ready to go when everyone got there. We had about 22 kids, divided over four lanes. It took a while to bowl just one game, but everyone had a great time. After bowling, we headed back to our house for dinner, cake, presents and playing.<br /><br />Everyone had an amazing time! The kids were happy and everyone got along so amazing. Tomorrow is their actual birthday (Sunday, February 5th) and we are having a Super Bowl party. It will be a great way to end their birthday weekend. I honestly hope this is a party they will remember for their entire lives. I don’t think I’ll forget it!</p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8512_5f9da369-f004-463d-8c1a-a36ae19343a1.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8527_b15aa9d0-294d-4b05-a22e-800afb7d0f7a.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2469491/2017/02/05/125b3e56d3086c5dc8f4ea1cae0dbd6e_d3949546-2f09-4866-bcfa-d73c3c171431.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8532_4622ef4d-77fb-44b4-8ded-2d6e46d371df.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8540_36fa2057-4d34-4778-9a96-d87dda605e3a.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8546_ac6cd8f7-b605-41c2-b711-fcbac6fc7092.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8547_cd90c8e4-f135-4cc0-8da4-11a8954aa29d.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8553_2f863197-b89c-416d-8b48-6cd95dd2ad30.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8555_dae4e8e8-f7b3-4a80-929d-8d39b1792224.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8558_47576c2b-6e13-44c2-ac1c-432f896c3877.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8561_94c8e6f6-1967-441f-818f-39648520aee5.JPG" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/user_images/13/2017/02/05/IMG_8587_b87d2ae7-49f7-4803-b74b-b570348336f2.JPG" /><p></p><p></p>

          <p>Analise had a run in with a bush outside when she and her friends were playing and got some scratches on her legs.
</p>
<p>She was crying about it hurting so I put some antibiotic cream on it.
</p>
<p>She claimed the Cream was stinging and was crying. I jokingly told her friends to blow on them and they immediately started to blow on the sting. It was just a what she needed to giggle and then get up and go back to playing.

          <p>Today was our last birthday party celebration, and it was a good end to the weekend. <br /><br />Analise still had Tink and Alyssa over from the sleepover so the day was spent playing. Analise was a little cranky, from lack of sleep I think, but overall she was okay. They spent most of the day playing outside. It was a gorgeous day!</p><p>We made cupcakes for today's party. The kids helped decorate some of them. I think they turned out great. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2470729/2017/02/13/d4e227f63c11b58fa1c5ef1a38588249_f2c112b3-bde5-4a8d-b7f2-b48e094a54e7.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2470729/2017/02/13/a296f15ad24a8b4060312d872c1eb016_fe9b6f78-7788-4166-b8d3-ac9e5ad9cbcb.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2470729/2017/02/13/76263981ac3a1b86df3e739ad8b63b68_59d83bd7-c1be-4ec8-8e93-39cdebb78c33.jpeg" /><p></p><p><br />Around 3 p.m., all our friends came over for a Super Bowl party. Ben's family ended up backing out and not coming, but that's okay. It means I got my spot on the couch. But we had a ton of leftover food! Oh well, Ben won't have to cook much this week. <br /><br />The game was pretty unbelievable. The Atlanta Falcons were playing the New England Patriots. Atlanta scored three times before the Patriots scored, and the Patriots only scored a field goal at first. They went into the 4th quarter with the Falcons leading 28-9. The Patriots had an unbelievable 4th score 19 unanswered points to tie the game and put it into overtime. <br /><br />They won the toss and got the ball and drove in for a touchdown to win the game. I couldn't believe that they won!<br /><br />The kids had a wonderful weekend and so did we. I'm pretty exhausted now, but happy I was able to celebrate my kids' birthday so big! I hope they never forget this birthday and more importantly, I hope they know how much I love them! </p>

          <p>Antonio competed at the district spelling bee yesterday. I had to miss it as I was traveling to Salt Lake City all day.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben was able to go, thankfully, but not without a little help. He had already planned the day off, but then Analise woke up sick. Thankfully, Uncle Reyes works from home and said she could come and lay on his couch while Ben attended.&nbsp;</p><p>Antonio did amazing, finishing in third place. He misspelled allegiance. He left out the second a. Not because he didn't know how to spell it, but because he just got ahead of himself and thought he said it. I'm so very very proud of him. He has no idea how proud!&nbsp;</p><p>I know he was disappointed in himself for losing but I couldn't be more proud!&nbsp;</p><p>Ben sent me this picture before he started. I just love it.

          <p>Antonio and I had a date night tonight. He came with me to the office after lunch with everyone. They were in Vegas for a dentist appointment. We met for lunch at Dairy Queen. </p><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2488641/2017/02/20/6f94f7a91b9d995ddb852650151bcb3e_96f00676-7d81-4941-ad93-2e799e8c808f.jpeg" /><p></p><p>After lunch, Antonio came back and toughed it out for the rest of the work day with me. He read some Harry Potter, played on his iPad and then watched a movie. Thanks to my dual monitor I was able to work while he watched the movie. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2488641/2017/02/20/469c0ac4330ca4963a04f97014ca254e_f6b4ab18-a380-4e69-ac3b-78882da154c2.jpeg" /><p></p><p>After work, we went shoe shopping. It took a few stores to find the right pair, but we found it. After shopping, we went to Game Works to play video games. It is always so much fun to spend time alone with Antonio. I truly love our relationship. </p><p>After games we went and had some pizza. It was yummy and we sat and talked instead of playing on phones. It was great to have time together with no electronics. </p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2488641/2017/02/20/37b94f206d9ebf3e213c02cdf260c887_80dcdd6b-d74a-49ad-9c88-010bb8a97ee3.jpeg" /><p></p><p>Then we were on our way home. It was the best Friday I've had in a long time. </p><p>And I must say, I was incredibly proud of his patience during the four hours at my office. </p><p></p>

        <div title="Tuesday, March 07, 2017" class="two-margin journal-text">
        
          <p>This week is a dress up week at school. I didn't get a picture of yesterday's day, which was fishing/camping/hat day. Analise and Antonio wore fishing hats and Isaiah wore his new Seahawks hat. That's what we wear fishing and camping.</p>
<p>Today was 80's day. I didn't find out it was 80s day until mid-day on Sunday, leaving me no time to prepare. So, we did the best we could. Mohawks and Ninja Turtle shirts for the boys, with sweatbands. And Analise is in jeans, high tops, a jean jacket and a side pony. I think that's 80s. I just remember bright colors that didn't totally match, or dresses. So...it works, I think. :)</p>

<p>On the way to school, these kids were cracking me up! They wanted me to put on some &quot;funky 80s music&quot;, &quot;Like Disco&quot; Antonio chimed in. I turned to look at him and laughed. He said, &quot;What, was disco the 70s?&quot; Then, he asked me if we even had radios in the 80s. I laughed so hard and told him, yes. He said, &quot;Well I didn't know! You didn't have phones!&quot; I said, &quot;Yes we did!&quot; At first he was shocked, answering with &quot;You did?!&quot; I said it wasn't a cell phone, but it pulled in to the house. He then said, &quot;Oh, I knew that! I meant cell phones.&quot; </p>
<p>It was a laugh riot all the way to school. I guess I officially understand what it's like to feel old! At least I haven't been asked if I had a pet dinosaur when I was growing up...yet!</p>

          <p>We have the best surprise coming up for you guys. Daddy and I have been talking about this for a long time, and I finally convinced him that we should get a puppy.</p><p>We've found the perfect one. We are going to name her Luna. Her Mom's name is Magic and I couldn't help but think of Harry Potter. Especially since Antonio has been reading it lately. </p><p>Hermoine is just too long of a name for a dog, plus ending in the &quot;e&quot; sound may be confusing to Missy. So, I was thinking about other females in the books and I thought of Luna Lovegood. She is a good friend to Harry, and a trusted companion. She is kind and gentle. So, Luna she will be. :)</p><p>And isn't she so adorable?! We get to bring her home on March 31st. I cannot wait to surprise you and see your reactions to her!</p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2514799/2017/03/13/d8a7ef4921249c5b01b79f1cc92b07ff_0be3a6d2-fe42-4ac1-99f0-c13b681515d0.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2514799/2017/03/13/79ee23f2dbbfdf21713a784ae70cd4b0_5aae77c3-c4ee-4d25-a1da-bfb211750d42.jpeg" /><p></p>

          <p>Today, after Ben left for his school field trip to Catalina, the kids and I slept a little longer and then headed to Vegas to watch the new Smurfs movie (Smurfs and the lost village). </p><p>The movie was really cute and we all enjoyed it. We took a couple selfies together after the movie.  </p><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2544353/2017/04/10/eaadd40833e7deb68f70d9550ebba0dc_1cb20cb9-0e18-4bd1-a7c1-6d3b19d502e4.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><p>After the movie we went to get a &quot;feel better soon&quot; gift for our friend Blake Jones. She had her tonsils removed on Friday and is having a rough recovery. </p><p>We took her flowers, a balloon on a stick that said feel better soon, and a purple stuffed dog. We surprised her with our quick visit and I think she was pleased with her gift. She definitely had a smile on her face!</p><p>After a very quick visit, we headed to Sports Clips for a haircut for Antonio. I don't think he thinks I do a good enough job. He settled for the base cost haircut and was happy with the cut. </p><p>We came home after that and made a stop at Smiths for some essentials (donuts, ice cream...you know, the basics) and the headed to the house and did a little cleaning, chatted with Ben on the phone and then took a little break. After the break, I gave Isaiah a hair cut. He cried the entire time because he was sad. A baby bird fell out of its nest by our back porch. It was so small it didn't even have feathers yet. It was going to die, a combination of the fall and not being warm enough or able to eat. Isaiah was super sad that it was going to die and couldn't stop crying for over an hour. </p><p>He and Antonio took a quick shower together and then we had some leftovers for dinner. We cuddled up on the couch together to watch Army Dog before the kids enjoyed some ice cream and then headed to bed. </p><p>It was a long Sunday and we're mostly ready for a week of school before Spring Break. But more ready for the break!</p><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2544353/2017/04/10/143e4babe572d04603ae9df1e07f53b6_36bbe053-08e3-4f66-815b-09626c1db74b.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2544353/2017/04/10/972ea597c6ac3b86fd6c0597686e8ff5_e40d983e-0882-416b-b0ad-542ca456d4d2.jpeg" /><p></p><p></p>

          <p>Some Isaiah funnies from tonight. We were at dinner and Isaiah had ordered some chicken. It was really hot and burned his tongue a little. When Ben asked if he could have a bite he said, "Yeah, if you're prepared to burn your tongue off!"&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Then on the drive home, somehow the discussion of being buried or cremated came up and Isaiah said, "I want to be ashed." I tried to hold in my laughter as I explained it was called cremated not ashed and that it was something he could decide on when he was older.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>This boy is just so funny!</p>

        <div title="Sunday, May 07, 2017" class="two-margin journal-title-text">Celebrating Isaiah's 6th birthday</div>
        <div title="Sunday, May 07, 2017" class="two-margin journal-text">
        
          <p>Today we had Isaiah's 6th birthday party. We had friends and family at our house to celebrate at Isaiah's Baseball party. </p><p>He asked for a Baseball party about two months ago and I began the preparations and finding ideas for the party. Birthday parties are a lot of work! I'm starting to understand a little more why I didn't ever have any growing up. My parents were just too darn busy to throw a party. Add to that the fact that all the costs of a party add up to be rather expensive. We definitely couldn't afford a party like we throw when I was growing up! </p><p>I'm just so happy that I can afford to throw parties for my kids. </p><p>For our Baseball party we had a Concessions area that included chips, cracker jacks, popcorn popped in a real popper, Red Vines, punch, soda, and baby ruth candy bars. We served Nachos and Hot Dogs along with chips, dip, veggies and fruit.</p><p>For the cake we did a cake that looked like a baseball and then cupcakes shaped like a glove with a baseball in the middle. Ben was amazing with the cake! I had a major fail on my first attempt and the cake just didn't want to come out of the pan. I spoke to a friend for some tips and our second cake turned out so much better!</p><p>Ben did the decorating as I'm just not that talented. I told him I wasn't domestic when I was near tears on Thursday night with my cake disaster! </p><p>I think the cake turned out great and Isaiah was really happy with it.</p><p>Ben made a corn hole game and I made the corn bags with baseball fabric. They turned out pretty cute, if I do say so myself. Ben also made a baseball game where you throw through the holes to mark either a single, double, triple or home run. The kids played the games and spent a good deal of time jumping on the trampoline. </p><p>Overall, it was a great party and I'm so happy that Isaiah was happy!</p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8787_cad6934c-0a8d-4143-a84f-ff6905417a36.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8790_60753b30-93da-4a83-b2a7-0128a1a07484.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8793_5b718c6e-8997-4bee-80b5-60af11517afd.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8798_26f02fe1-6522-4a2f-ab0b-a2971e09c21b.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8799_37745fa9-86e5-4fa6-8e80-ac5390c7fb52.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8698_adeec790-e673-4ba0-80c8-5d9bb459281a.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8760_602b5986-3663-4d1c-8268-37eeef8bd195.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8771_cdaf053c-bc81-4021-9ba7-0b98ead40e03.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8773_5bd260fb-84e2-42bc-8ed9-8f35239cedf8.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8684_5e226312-436d-4449-9b92-c66ed7c086fa.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8687_f27c38b6-4e23-4edd-9903-26280ec23654.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8801_9c923c85-9ed0-4f49-8cf0-5e5ecb1a89bd.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8802_7036b63f-bdf9-48b4-ba95-683d071ed5f6.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8804_444c6240-ed6d-4768-ad6f-380f09b94602.JPG" /><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2572160/2017/05/07/IMG_8806_1fcfe95b-0f66-4298-bb10-18ab270f7ee5.JPG" /><p></p>

And I hate it!</p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2588960/2017/05/22/image00_97781b3e-c38e-4480-89e0-66663ae48de5.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2588960/2017/05/22/image01_07a67f0a-8b2a-49ff-8647-c15f2f25eb8d.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2588960/2017/05/22/image02_5dc14159-ff5d-4219-8616-88b853542e85.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2588960/2017/05/22/image03_67811619-cb66-48c8-9756-ec8c047280f2.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2588960/2017/05/22/image04_77978d9e-2d9c-4dc0-8639-009e540ac038.jpg" /><p></p>

          <p>I have the greatest kids. Really and truly, they are awesome. Today has been a long day and it isn't close to over yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Our flight to Cincinnati is delayed. Delayed...a lot. Our departure time of 9 am was bumped to 3:10 pm. I got the notification last night but it also said it was subject to change and it could be earlier. What are we supposed to do when we live an hour away?</p><p>So we got up at 4 am anyway. Antonio heard me listening to a voicemail from the airline at 4 and we discussed what we should do. We decided to stay awake, get ready and head to Vegas.&nbsp;</p><p>We arrived at the airport a little before 7 am. We had tons of time so of course everyone got up and ready with no issue or delay. When we arrived, we went ahead and checked our bags. Then we left and headed to IHOP for some breakfast.</p><p>We took our time with breakfast, then headed to Petco to walk around and look at the animals. We had to wait a little bit for it to open and I was able to catch a little nap in the air conditioned van before going in.&nbsp;</p><p>After Petco we went to Target for a couple of things then headed to Bass Pro Shop to look at all the fish in the tanks. We killed time there and then the kids were getting restless and were ready to get to the airport.&nbsp;</p><p>We grabbed some sandwiches at Subway then headed to the airport. Analise and Isaiah cried when Ben had to leave us at security. They were sad he couldn't go with us.&nbsp;</p><p>When we got to the gate, we finished Father of the Bride on my laptop. They have been so well behaved and patient. We still haven't boarded yet and they have done a great job waiting.&nbsp;</p><p>We got meal vouchers so we used them to buy donuts and extra&nbsp;drinks since we had eaten our sandwiches.&nbsp;</p><p>They have been waiting for "a million years" and they just want to get there. I can't blame them, so do I. But I'm proud of how well they've done being patient and waiting. I'm hopeful we'll get to board soon!</p>

Mom didn't cry, but it was a close one!</p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image00_e3f26d1a-42f6-4aca-927d-27fb2da9c191.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image01_ad9c13ba-ca88-4a3e-9f9c-82ea9f0fea6d.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image02_9e203967-c823-458d-b094-b9a1d891ad34.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image03_f0115c23-3d1a-42df-b809-871f4afc218f.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image04_3e5508f4-cd41-4b67-b26e-b43c87558dbc.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image05_1ad20529-4c0f-4c4d-8aa8-ccc6a4be5d23.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image06_2950256f-2c64-4011-bad7-f1fb734a3f3e.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image07_98675ef6-c32f-4be2-aeca-ed2f0712031a.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image08_15565208-2ff4-4c5d-86c7-232229387c31.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image09_c5970751-041b-4c2b-8234-e3ccff40f148.jpg" /><p></p><p></p><img src="https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/entry_images/13/2670106/2017/08/07/image10_97621d75-9510-4cd3-b301-853a8f2530ba.jpg" /><p></p>

Analise was telling me about the test on the way to school this morning, and the parts she thought she might have messed up.</p><p>As she was describing it, she was telling me about solving some of the problems and she said, &quot;There were w's and i's...those aren't even numbers, how are you supposed to even figure that out?!&quot; I couldn't help but giggle! I know she'll do great this year!</p><p>As I was letting them out of the car, Isaiah says to me, &quot;Have a great day! Don't get fired!!&quot; I told him I would do my best not to.

          <p>Last night, Isaiah still needed to do his reading home when we all got home (Ben and the kids from football practice and me from work). So, I told him to go pick and book and we would read it together. </p><p>He brought out Dixie and the Class Treat. He said it was his favorite book, even though I had never read it with him before. I said, okay, let's do it. </p><p>He read the WHOLE BOOK! I helped him with a couple of words that aren't easily sounded out but all the rest was all him. I'm so very impressed with his reading ability and how well he is doing in school! He is a little rockstar.</p><p>The other two are doing great as well, but this is a &quot;brag about Isaiah&quot; entry. </p><p>Way to go, Zay!!</p>

          <p>My Dad (Papaw) shared this on Facebook. I think many of these rules are very important to remember as you grow from a boy to a man. For Analise - many of these rules apply to you as well! Love you all!</p><p>Rules For My Son<br />AUGUST 23, 2017<br /><br />1. Never shake a man’s hand sitting down. (I would modify this to say never shake someone's hand while sitting down)</p><p>2. There are plenty of ways to enter a pool. The stairs ain’t one.</p><p>3. The man at the grill is the closest thing we have to a king.</p><p>4. In a negotiation, never make the first offer.</p><p>5. Act like you’ve been there before. Especially in the end zone.</p><p>6. Request the late check-out.</p><p>7. When entrusted with a secret, keep it.</p><p>8. Hold your heroes to a higher standard.</p><p>9. Return a borrowed car with a full tank of gas.</p><p>10. Don’t fill up on bread.</p><p>11. When shaking hands, grip firmly and look him in the eye. (I would add, look him or her in the eye)</p><p>12. Don’t let a wishbone grow where a backbone should be.</p><p>13. If you need music on the beach, you’re missing the point.</p><p>14. Carry two handkerchiefs. The one in your back pocket is for you. The one in your breast pocket is for her.</p><p>15. You marry the girl, you marry her whole family. (For Analise, same goes for you sweetie. You marry the boy, you marry his whole family)</p><p>16. Be like a duck. Remain calm on the surface and paddle like crazy underneath.</p><p>17. Experience the serenity of traveling alone.</p><p>18. Never be afraid to ask out the best looking girl in the room. (Or the best looking boy for you, Sis)</p><p>19. Never turn down a breath mint.</p><p>20. In a game of HORSE, sometimes a simple free throw will get ’em.</p><p>21. A sport coat is worth 1000 words.</p><p>22. Try writing your own eulogy. Never stop revising.</p><p>23. Thank a veteran. And then make it up to him.</p><p>24. If you want to know what makes you unique, sit for a caricature.</p><p>25. Eat lunch with the new kid.</p><p>26. After writing an angry email, read it carefully. Then delete it.</p><p>27. Ask your mom to play. She won’t let you win.</p><p>28. See it on the big screen.</p><p>29. Give credit. Take the blame.</p><p>30. Write down your dreams.</p>

          <p>So this morning I was sharing an old post on Facebook of Isaiah when he was a baby. It was a video where I asked if he was ready for a picture and he gave me his cheese face. Seriously...so dang cute! </p><p>He asked what I was doing and I said I was sharing it on Facebook. His immediate reaction was &quot;What?! No! I hate when you post me on Facebook.&quot; I told him I had already posted it a long time ago and that I was just sharing it again. </p><p>When I told him that Papaw had said he was the cutest ever and that he wanted me to post new things, he asked what I said. I told him I responded that he didn't like when I posted stuff about him on Facebook, but that I would see what I could do.</p><p>He said, &quot;Ugh, I guess you can post me, but just not any pictures of me when I don't like food. I'm watching you!&quot; And then he did that thing where he points two fingers at his eyes then at me, to show me he was watching me. I couldn't hold in the laugh. He's so funny!!</p>

If she agrees that the person is deserving, then they receive the honor. Analise was one of the winners this month.</p><p>I'm so proud of her and her hard work.
