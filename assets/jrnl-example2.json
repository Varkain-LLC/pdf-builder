The fish was golden and very slippery!</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">In the afternoon, I decided to have a nap because I was so tired <span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">of</span> fishing! At that moment, a huge <span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">brown</span> bear came charging through the woods like thunder. Some hunters from my tribe ran away but I stood my ground and began to throw spears at the growling, snarling bear! How was I going to <span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">getaway</span>! The spears didn\u2019t work so I grabbed my hand made bow and arrow and started shooting at it. Whimpering, the bear tumbled to the ground. YES! We had defeated it!</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">As the <span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">sunset</span> in the sky, my belly began to grumble. What was I going to eat? I skipped back to my family\u2019s hut and asked my Mum for something to eat whilst my baby sister lay on her fur skin mat. She was cooking some raw, mammoth meat on the fire and it smelt delicious. We were running out of wood so I went outside to look for some. Fortunately, I had some <span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">leftover</span> from my boat! Once the mammoth was cooked, I began to eat it. Unfortunately, it tasted disgusting, however<span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">,</span> it filled me up!</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">I wonder what will happen tomorrow\u2026</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>",

I really didn\u2019t want to wake up so early on a Saturday, but I\u2019m saving money to buy a new iPod and couldn\u2019t say no to an all-day babysitting job.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">When I arrived at Smith\u2019s house, both kids were already awake. &nbsp;Madison was watching cartoons in <span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">the </span>living room and Jacob was playing with his Legos in his bedroom. The kids were hungry so I made them some oatmeal in the microwave and we all ate breakfast together.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">We had to leave right after breakfast for Jacob\u2019s soccer practice. &nbsp;Luckily, the Smiths only live a couple<span style=\"font-family: Roboto\"> of</span> blocks from the soccer field so we just walked there. &nbsp;It was a lot of fun watching Jacob play soccer. &nbsp;He\u2019s very talented. I was worried that Madison might be bored, but she stayed busy by playing her Gameboy while Jacob practiced.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">When practice was over, we went back to the house to make lunch. &nbsp;It\u2019s always a breeze to make lunch for the Smith kids because they love chicken nuggets and French fries. &nbsp;All I had to do was pull the food out of the freezer and bake it in the oven.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">After lunch, I planned a special surprise for the kids...I took them to see the new Disney movie. &nbsp;The movie theater is a few miles away from their house so I had to call my mom to pick us up in her car and drive us there. &nbsp;The kids loved the movie; they couldn\u2019t stop laughing. &nbsp;I have to admit that I thought it was pretty funny too. &nbsp;The only bad part was that the theater had the air conditioning cranked up and it was freezing cold!</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">My mom picked us up again after the movie and took us back to the Smith\u2019s house. &nbsp;We had only been back for a few minutes when Mrs. Smith came back home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">I </span>didn\u2019t expect her home so soon, but she was back early because the power went out at her office.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">It worked out very well though because as soon as I left Smith\u2019s, Danielle called to see if I wanted to go to the mall. &nbsp;I checked in at home to make sure it was ok and then met Danielle at her house.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">While we were at the mall, we definitely \u201cshopped \u2018til we dropped\u201d. &nbsp;I bought a t-shirt, a sweater, a pair of jeans, and some flip flops. &nbsp;I know that I won\u2019t need the flip flops for much longer since it\u2019s already October, but they were on clearance and I couldn\u2019t pass them up.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Finally<span style=\"font-family: Roboto\">,</span> after all that shopping, we headed home because I was exhausted. &nbsp;Today was a fun day, but I can\u2019t wait to sleep in tomorrow!</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<figure><figure><img src=\"https://jrnl.s3.amazonaws.com/dev/entry_images/66229/2020/07/30/SFT16612AQ_9ff8c8be-aadb-4fa6-accb-41fa516611e9.jpg\" caption=\"\" alignment=\"center\" width=\"48\" style='position:relative; cursor: default; width: 48%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>",

I don\u2019t even know where to begin!</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">To start off, I think I completely failed my geometry quiz, which I know I should\u2019ve studied more for...my dad\u2019s not gonna be happy about that. :( Then, we had a pop quiz in history on the reading homework from last night, and I completely forgot most of what I read, which made me even more upset because I actually did the reading! But what really made me mad was the note that Sarah slipped into my locker during passing period. She said she was sad that I\u2019ve been hanging out with Jane more lately and thinks that I don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore. I can\u2019t believe she thinks that, especially after talking with her on the phone for hours and hours last month while she was going through her breakup with Nick! Just because I\u2019ve been hanging out with Jane a little more than usual doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not her friend anymore. She completely blew me off at lunch, and when I told Jane, she thought that Sarah was being a \u201cdrama queen.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">This is just what I need! My parents are getting on my case about doing more extracurricular activities, I have a huge paper due for AP English soon, and I can\u2019t understand a thing in advanced Spanish! The last thing I need is for my best friend to think I hate her and barely text me back anymore.</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Uggh!
